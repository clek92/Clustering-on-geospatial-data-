# Clustering-on-geospatial-data-
Clustering on geospatial data of ships from AIS antenna located at the university of Piraeus https://www.datastories.org/univ-piraeus-ais-stream-visualization/ <br>
The data have been pre-processed on another file in order to create a final dataset for exploration<br>
Clustering and analysis are done with the help of moving pandas library <br>
The first goal of the project was to identify locations of interest or any form of pattern such as docks, high traffic routes or places of commercial/tourist interest <br>
The second goal is to de-anonymize the ships and try to identify as many ship names as possible
